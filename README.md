# The Book I scribbled about RICA (It's nearly 20 years old, but people still like the content)
https://www.amazon.com/Beating-Elementary-Literacy-Instruction-Certification/dp/0205394728/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488920609&sr=8-1&keywords=boosalis

The notebook is dated, and I compiled it from various websites in the public domain. The content is presented for academic purposes only. The pages mostly line up with the videos, but I lost the original one that I made several hard drives ago. I just happened to find this one by luck. 

Remember that no guarantee of success accompanies your reading or viewing experience. 

Best of luck,
