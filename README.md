# Reading Instruction Workbook
This .pdf (https://github.com/cboosalis/RICA/blob/master/RICA-NOTEBOOK-1.pdf) goes with these videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF37AD70E260F17FB).

After following the link to the .pdf, just click download and the file should...download. 

The notebook is dated, and I compiled it from various public websites owned by Pearson/NES Inc. The content is presented for academic purposes only. The pages mostly line up with the videos, but I lost the original one that I made several hard drives ago. I just happened to find this one by luck. 

Remember that no guarantee of success accompanies your reading or viewing experience. 

Best of luck,
Chris B.
