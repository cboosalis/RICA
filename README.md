This (https://github.com/cboosalis/RICA/blob/2dfd459b941c3daba455308d300c8b50747a76cc/RICA-NOTEBOOK-1.pdf) goes with that (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF37AD70E260F17FB)

It is probably easier just to right click (or whatever Mac users do...Command + something?) and save the .pdf to your computer.

Yeah...some of the pages are different, etc., from the videos but this doc is what I was able to recover and upload.

Anyway, hope that it helps somebody out there.
