# Reading Instruction Workbook
This .pdf (https://github.com/cboosalis/RICA/blob/master/RICA-NOTEBOOK-1.pdf) goes with these videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF37AD70E260F17FB).

The notebook is dated, and I compiled it from various public websites owned by Pearson/NES Inc. The content is presented for academic purposes only. The pages mostly line up with the videos, but I lost the original one that I made several hard drives ago. I just happened to find this one by luck. 

Remember that no guarantee of success accompanies your reading or viewing experience. 

Note that it is probably easier to just save the document to your computer, rather than following the link. 

Best of luck,
Chris B.
